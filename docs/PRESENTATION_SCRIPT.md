# Will It Snow? Hype Meter - Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## 0:00 - 0:30: The Hook & The Problem
**Speaker**: "Raise your hand if you've checked the weather app today. Keep your hand up if you felt *anything* when you did it. Exacty."

"Weather apps are boring. They give you numbers, data, and charts. But when a snowstorm is coming, we don't want data. We want **HYPE**. We want to know: **Is school cancelled?** **Do I need to buy milk and bread?**"

"Introducing the **Will It Snow? Hype Meter** - the first weather app designed for pure emotional validation."

## 0:30 - 1:30: The Live Demo
*(Open the App - Start on a boring city like Miami or San Francisco)*

**Speaker**: "Let's check Miami. As you can see... **'JUST COLD'**. The app knows it's a dud. The background is dark, the vibe is low. It's telling me to go do my homework."

*(Click on ANCHORAGE or CHICAGO - Pick one with snow)*

**Speaker**: "But wait... what about Anchorage? **BOOM!**"
*(Pause for visual effect - Snow particles, glitch text, red/cyan glow)*

**Speaker**: "The Hype Meter detects the storm. The background glows red. The blizzard kicks in. The verdict is **'SCHOOL CLOSING IMMINENT'**. This isn't just a forecast; it's a mood."

*(Demonstrate Zipcode Search)*

**Speaker**: "And for those of you in specific neighborhoods, we built a **Zipcode Search**. Let's check **90210**."
*(Type 90210 -> hit GO)*
**Speaker**: "Beverly Hills. 61 degrees. Total dud. The app creates a custom AI summary roasting the location in real-time."

## 1:30 - 2:00: The Tech & Closing
**Speaker**: "Under the hood, we aren't just making things up. This is powered by:
1.  **React & Vite** for the frontend.
2.  **Open-Meteo API** for live, real-time weather data.
3.  **Zippopotam.us** for geocoding.
4.  And a custom **'Hype Engine'** that translates boring temperature data into pure adrenaline."

"So next time you're wondering if you have a snow day... don't check the weather. Check the Hype."

"Thank you!"
